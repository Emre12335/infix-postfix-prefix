# infix-postfix-prefix
convertion of infix/postfix/prefix \n 
Computer can't understand the priorities of the transactions so in order to realize transactions without any fault it converts infix demonstration to postfix or prefix\n demonstration\n\n  

Infix: Normal mathematical demonstration of transactions such as 5+3*9 There are operators among the operands\n
Postix/Prefix: Converted versions of infix in postfix operands come first, in prefix operators come first\n
Postfix ex: 5+3*9 -> 539*+\n
Prefix ex: 5+3*9 -> +5*39\n
\n
I didn't explain logique behind it there is just code written in python\n
