# infix-postfix-prefix
convertion of infix/postfix/prefix

Computer can't understand the priorities of the transactions so in order to realize transactions without any fault it converts infix demonstration to postfix or prefix demonstration  

Infix: Normal mathematical demonstration of transactions such as 5+3x9 There are operators among the operands

Postix/Prefix: Converted versions of infix; in postfix operands come first, in prefix operators come first

Postfix ex: 5+3x9 -> 539x+

Prefix ex: 5+3x9 -> +5x39

I didn't explain logique behind it there is just code written in python
