# infix-postfix-prefix
convertion of infix/postfix/prefix 
Computer can't understand the priorities of the transactions so in order to realize transactions without any fault it converts infix demonstration to postfix or prefix demonstration   

Infix: Normal mathematical demonstration of transactions such as 5+3*9 There are operators among the operands
Postix/Prefix: Converted versions of infix in postfix operands come first, in prefix operators come first
Postfix ex: 5+3*9 -> 539*+
Prefix ex: 5+3*9 -> +5*39

I didn't explain logique behind it there is just code written in python
